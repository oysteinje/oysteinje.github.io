# Objective

This article aims to solve the following: 

- Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups for an Entra ID group.
- Configure PIM role settings for the group to allow permanent assignments of members.
- Assign a user as a permanent eligible member.
- Elevate my access to the group. 

All points should be completed using PowerShell. 

# Access required 

If you want to automate this using your local user then the least privileged Entra ID access is `Privileged Role Administrator`. This role contains the Graph permission PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup which is required for configuring PIM for Groups. 

If you want to automate this using an app registration then you must grant the identity the graph application permission `PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureADGroup`. 

# Authentication

< add content > 

# Change an group from normal group to an PIM group 

# Configure the PIM role settings to allow permanent assignments of members

# Assign a user permanent active assignment 

# Elevat my access to the group
